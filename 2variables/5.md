Look at the following programs...

x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

and...

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?

In the first program, x prints 3 to the screen. This is because the .times method will execute the block (x += 1), 3 times, so each of those times, 1 is added to the value of x. 

In the second program, x gives an error "undefined local variable or method `x'" . This is because of the variable scope of x, since it was initialized within the block, it can only be accessed within the same block.
