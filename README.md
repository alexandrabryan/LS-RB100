# LS-RB100

This is a repo to hold my code for the exercised completed in the Launch School prep course, RB 100. These exercises come from the book "Introduction to Programming with Ruby," written by Launch School.

In this README, I will also keep track of my daily progress with a short description of what was done, on that date.
